# To do (in order of priority)

* Make calendar images with appropriate numbers for days of month
* Detail screens for enrollments and courses
* Modify NetworkDataLoader to use OAuth2 properly
* Loading information instead of blank tableview (shadow overlay?)
* Edge insets only work for one tab (disabled for now)
